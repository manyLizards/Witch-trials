### Installation
You will need to install Phaser in the integrated terminal using `npm install phaser@3.55.2`

### Testing
enter `npx http-server [path] [options]` to open an easy testing web server.

For a more complex web server that we can use if what we have is too big for npx, take a look at [WampServer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/wampserver/files/)
